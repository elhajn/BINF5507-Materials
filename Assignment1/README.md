# BINF5507 Assignment 1

This folder contains the deliverables for BINF5507 - Machine Learning and AI for Bioinformatics, Assignment 1.
    Given an unprocessed dataset, skeleton code for preprocessing, and a simple model, clean and preprocess the data before running it through the model.

The preprocessing functions and the model used for this assignment can be found in "data_processing.py" in the "Scripts" folder. The jupyter notebook "main" (also in the "Scripts" folder) imports the dataset and the data processing script and applies the preprocessing steps and the model to the dataset in a Python kernel. Please see the pixi.toml file in the main repository for information on dependencies.
